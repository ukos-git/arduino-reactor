# arduino-swnt-reactor
Modbus Protocol simplification for a EUROTHERM 2416 PID controller.
Analogous stearing of valves and readout/control of pressure
arduino output is in ASCII and can be read with every editor.
For future version readout will be done by python-swnt-reactor (application not ready yet).
